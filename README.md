Hi,

My name is MArion Fresquet and this repository contains my technical test for the apprenticeship position at Servier.
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline was initially developed in a Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab, then converted into a standalone Python script for portability.
A link to the original notebook is included at the top of the Python file.
I hope this RAG implementation meets your expectations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
